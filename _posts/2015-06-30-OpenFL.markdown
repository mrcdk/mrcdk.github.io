description: <i>OpenFL</i> (Open Flash Library) is a fast, open-source implementation of the industry-standard Flash API. OpenFL uses <a href="http://www.haxe.org" target="_blank">Haxe</a> and implements hardware rendering. It compiles to Flash, HTML5 and native C++ targeting desktop, web, smartphones, smartTVs and consoles.
my-work: My work in OpenFL is to build the next version with a better performance and an unified codebase for all targets moving the majority of the code from C++ to Haxe.
