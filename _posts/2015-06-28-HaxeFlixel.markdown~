description: <i>HaxeFlixel</i> is an awesome library to make games. It was a port to Haxe of <i>Flixel</i> which uses AS3. It builds on top of OpenFL and can target a lot of different targets like Windows, Linux, Mac OS X, Flash, Android, iOS, HTML5, Neko,...
my-work: I've made some contributions to this framework before like animated tiles for a tilemap. My last contribution is per camera post-processing support thanks to my work on OpenFL adding custom shader support on it.
