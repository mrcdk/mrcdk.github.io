description: Fifteen years after humanity’s glorious victory over the pacifist G’ell, the aliens have returned with a fleet and the unabashed hatred for humans they need to use it. Lock and load with the last remnants of mankind’s resistance in DSP, a retro-sexy, roguelike SHMUP set in the Starr Mazer universe!
my-work: I worked on the engine which was based on OpenFL, gameplay and the UI of the game. The game is multiplatform running on Windows, Linux and Mac OS.
