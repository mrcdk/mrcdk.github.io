description: The concept is very simple, you move your guys around with your finger. And when you do, they COME ALIVE AND FIGHT the bad guys. <i>Rune Raiders</i> a simple adventure game that takes SECONDS TO LEARN, but provides hilarious action for all!
my-work: The game was coded for native platforms and flash in mind using OpenFL. Thanks to my work with OpenFL we were able to port this game to HTML5 targets (using canvas and webGL) and we could publish it in the Firefox Marketplace!
